> A Greek alphabet Alfred Snippet. 

There are 54 letters, some come with their variation form, e.g. rho(varrho), epsilon(varepsilon). 

## Installation
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is required.
Download the file [GreekAlphabet.alfredsnippets](https://github.com/BaksiLi/Greek-Alphabet-Alfred-Snippet/blob/master/GreekAlphabet.alfredsnippets)

Activate your snippet using Hotkey or `snip` in Alfred, type the keyword therefore paste the letter.
The keywords of all the snippets starts with `;`.

## Reference
- The naming of the keywords is inspired by LaTeX, an example illustration see [this](http://web.ift.uib.no/Teori/KURS/WRK/TeX/sym1.html).
- The icon is created by myself using LaTeXiT:
  ``` LaTeX
  $\alpha\lambda\phi\acute{\alpha}\beta\eta\tau o$
  ```
